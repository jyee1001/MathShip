MathShip is a desktop application made with JavaFX and SceneBuilder. The goal of this application is to get the player familarized with simple arithmetic operations. 
The player is shown an inequality at the top of the screen. While playing the game they are suppose to maintain the inequality to be true. 
Shooting red fire balls results in multiplying the current inequality value by 2. 
Shooting purple blue balls results in dividing the current inequality value by 2.
Green ball = decrement
Pink ball = increment

This project is still currently being worked on.
